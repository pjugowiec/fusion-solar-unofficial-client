Creating a FusionSolar client requires the use of a factory static method that will create the client instances.

The basic thing is to log in to get a **XSRF-TOKEN** token. After obtaining the token, get code/codes of the stations from which you want to get data,
you can do it using the **getStationList** -> **stationCode** method or just from FusionSolar panel. Subsequent methods provide the target data.

If you have any questions, please create an issue.
